# Matrix Profile: from offline to extreme edge-incremental case

The matrix profile constitutes a data structure and a set of algorithms that facilitates the resolution of challenges in time series analysis. It is characterized by its robustness, scalability, and minimal reliance on parameters. The subject holds significant implications for various analytical techniques, including time series motif discovery, time series joins (joining two long time series based on their most correlated segments), and shapelet discovery for classification purposes. Indeed, shapelets are time series snippets that can be used to classify unlabeled time series. Additionally, it impacts the fields of density estimation, semantic segmentation, visualization, rule discovery, and clustering, among others.
