#
# The TBATS (Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA
# errors, Trend, and Seasonal components) model is a powerful method
# for time series forecasting that can handle multiple seasonalities
# and complex patterns. If you want to implement TBATS in Python
# without using the sktime library, you can use other libraries like
# statsmodels for ARMA modeling and custom implementations for the
# other components.
#
# Below is a simplified version of TBATS using Python. This
# implementation will cover the basic structure and logic of the TBATS
# model, but it may not be as optimized or feature-complete as the
# sktime version.
#
# Step-by-Step Implementation
#   Box-Cox Transformation: To stabilize the variance.
#   Trend and Seasonal Decomposition: Using moving averages or other
#   decomposition methods.
#   ARMA Modeling: For residuals.
#   Back-Transformation: To get the final forecast.
#
# Required Libraries
#   numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
#   scipy for Box-Cox transformation.
#   statsmodels for ARMA modeling.
