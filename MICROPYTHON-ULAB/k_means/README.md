# Directory content

This directory contains the sources, adapted from River, of the online k_means. We also committed the sources of the required Python modules since ulab does not implement all of them. Sources for the missing modules can be found through
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python/cpython/3.12/Lib/types.py | abc.py | reprlib.py | ...`

The main file is k_means.py
