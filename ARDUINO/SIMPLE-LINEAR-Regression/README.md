## Simple linear regression

The goal of simple linear regression is to predict the value of a dependent variable based on an independent variable. The greater the linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, the more accurate the prediction. This goes hand in hand with the fact that the greater the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable, the more accurate the prediction. Visually, the relationship between variables can be represented by a scatterplot. The greater the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, the more the data points lie on a straight line.
