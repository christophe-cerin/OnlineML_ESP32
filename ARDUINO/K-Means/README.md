## What is k-means clustering ?

K-means clustering allows us to find groups of similar points in a dataset. K-means clustering involves finding groups of points in a data set such that the total variance within the groups is minimized. K-means clustering is the task of partitioning the feature space into k subsets to minimize within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) deviations, which is the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between each data point and the centroid.
