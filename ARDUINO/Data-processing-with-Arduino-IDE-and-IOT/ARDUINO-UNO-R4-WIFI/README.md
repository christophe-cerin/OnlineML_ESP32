# Storing Data from Serial Port to Disk

**Abstract**

This project aims to display real-time temperature and humidity on an LCD screen and then save this data to a local or remote computer.
To achieve this, we're using an  Arduino Uno R4 Wifi board and the  Arduino IDE to program the system. Additional hardware includes a DHT22 sensor , a potentiometer, a 16x2 LCD screen, and a breadboard.
Traditionally, data is stored on an SD card, which is why the `SD.h` library is commonly included. This would allow for creating a read/write file to record temperature and humidity in two columns, provided the SD card's CS pin is correctly configured in the program.
However, using flash memory as a storage solution isn't considered due to its very limited capacity.
For a data logging system with minimal constraints, we are prioritizing direct storage on the laptop's hard drive or on a remote computer.

## 3. Two Essential Programs for Our Method

Our approach relies on the use of two distinct programs. The first program is an Arduino program (file: tempHumLcdDHThdstatus.ino), whose data is read via the serial port of the Arduino IDE.

**Description of the tempHumLcdDHThdstatus.ino program :**

 - Main Functionality: Real-time display of ambient temperature and humidity on an LCD screen, as well as saving this data to a computer via the serial port.
 - Objective: This program is designed to display data (temperature and humidity readings) measured by a DHT22 sensor on the Arduino IDE's serial monitor (or to a Python script) for PC logging. The DHT22 sensor is connected to digital pin 13 of an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi board.
  - Author: M SOW
  - Creation Date: 03.07.2025
  - Libraries Used:
    - The program includes two essential libraries:
       - <LiquidCrystal.h>: Used to control the 16x2 LCD screen.
       - <SimpleDHT.h>: Facilitates reading data from the DHT22 sensor.
  - Specific Arduino Script Enhancements:
    - Uses the read2() function for more precise floating-point values.
    - Improved error handling with direct display on the LCD screen.
    - Addition of Serial.flush() to ensure all data is sent.
    - More robust CSV output format, including an error status.
    - Display of values with one decimal place.
     
**Recommended Serial Monitor Configuration :**

 - Option 1: Open the Arduino IDE's serial monitor with a baud rate of 115200, then click "Save output" to save the data.
 - Option 2: Use an external program such as a console/terminal (on Linux/Mac) with a Python script to capture the data streamed over the serial port.

**Pin and Object Definitions**

Constants define the Arduino pins connected to the LCD screen and the DHT22 sensor:
 - rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7: Pins for the LCD screen interface.
 - POTENTIOMETRE (A0): Analog pin for the potentiometer (although not used in the data reading/sending logic, it is declared).
 - pinDHT22 (13): Digital pin to which the DHT22 sensor is connected.

Two objects are instantiated:
 - LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7): The LCD object is created with the defined pins.
 - SimpleDHT22 dht22: The object for the DHT22 sensor is created.

**setup() Function**

This function executes once when the Arduino starts:
 - 1. Serial.begin(115200): Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 115200.
 - 2. while(!Serial): Waits for the serial connection to be established (useful for boards that reset when the serial monitor is opened).
 - 3. pinMode(POTENTIOMETRE, INPUT): Configures the potentiometer pin as an input.
 - 4. lcd.begin(16,2): Initializes the LCD screen with 16 columns and 2 rows.
 - 5. Displays a startup message ("Demarrage...") on the LCD screen for 2 seconds, then clears it.
 - 6. Serial.println("timestamp_ms,temperature_C,humidity_pct,status"): Sends the column header to the serial monitor. This CSV format is crucial for data logging.
 - 7. Serial.flush(): Ensures the header is sent immediately.

**envoyerVersPC() Function**

This custom function is responsible for sending data to the PC via the serial port, in CSV format:
  - It takes temperature (temp), humidity (hum), and an optional status (defaulting to "OK") as parameters.
  - Serial.print(millis()): Sends the time elapsed since the Arduino started in milliseconds.
  - Serial.print(temp, 1) and Serial.print(hum, 1): Send temperature and humidity with one decimal place.
  - Serial.println(status): Sends the reading status (e.g., "OK" or "ERROR_XX").
  - Serial.flush(): Forces immediate data transmission to ensure it doesn't remain in the buffer.
    
**loop() Function**

This function runs continuously after setup():
- 1. DHT22 Sensor Reading:
  - dht22.read2(pinDHT22, &temperature, &humidity, NULL): Attempts to read temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor.
  - Error Handling: If the reading fails (err != SimpleDHTErrSuccess), an error message is displayed on the LCD screen with the error code, and an error line is sent to the PC via envoyerVersPC(0, 0, "ERROR_" + String(err)). The program waits 2 seconds before retrying.
- 2. LCD Display (if successful):
  - Clears the screen.
  - Displays the current temperature and humidity on both lines of the LCD screen.
- 3. Send to PC:
  - envoyerVersPC(temperature, humidity): Calls the function to send the read data (temperature, humidity, and "OK" status) to the PC.
- 4. delay(3000): The program pauses for 3 seconds before the next reading, meaning data is read and sent every 3 seconds.

## 4. The Second Program: recuperationDataArretTimerEachTime.py (Python)

The second program is a script written in Python, named recuperationDataArretTimerEachTime.py.

**Key Features :**

 - This Python script is designed to automatically detect and use the correct serial port.
 - With each execution, it will create a unique storage file for the data.
 - The captured data will be saved in a CSV file, including a timestamp for each entry.

**Usage Instructions :**

 1. Upload the Arduino code (tempHumLcdDHThdstatus.ino) to your Arduino board.    
 2. Close the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor. This is a crucial step to free up the serial port.    
 3. Execute the Python script using the command: python3 recuperationDataArretTimerEachTime.py.    
 4. Data will then begin to be automatically saved into the generated CSV file.

**Description of the Python Data Retrieval Script**

This Python script (recuperationDataArretTimerEachTime.py) is designed to automate serial port detection, read data from a sensor (like the DHT22 via Arduino), save this data to a local CSV file, and automatically stop after a defined duration.

**Key Features**

 - Automatic Arduino Port Detection: The script attempts to find the serial port to which the Arduino is connected by iterating through a list of common ports on different operating systems (Linux/macOS and Windows).
 - Serial Connection: Once the port is detected, it establishes a serial connection with the Arduino at a baud rate of 115200.
 - Timestamped CSV File Creation: Each time it runs, a new CSV file is created with a unique name based on the current timestamp (e.g., donnees_capteur_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv).
 - Data Logging: Data read from the Arduino's serial port is written to the CSV file. Each line of data is preceded by a real-time timestamp (PC date and time) for better traceability.
 - CSV File Header: The CSV file includes a clear header (date_time,arduino_timestamp_ms,temperature_C,humidity_pct,status) to facilitate data analysis.
 - Real-time Display: The script displays the received data and progress status (current minute out of total duration) directly in the console.
 - Automatic Stop: Recording automatically stops after a predefined duration (by default, 10 minutes), ensuring controlled data collection.
 - Error Handling: The script includes try-except blocks to handle common errors such as inability to open the serial port, decoding errors, or keyboard interruptions.

**Code Structure**

 1. Imports:
    - Imports necessary modules (serial, time, datetime, os, sys).

 3. trouver_port_arduino():
  -This function iterates over a list of possible serial ports.
  - It attempts to open and close each port to check its availability.
  - If a port is found and accessible, its name is returned; otherwise, None is returned.
    
 3. main():
  - Calls trouver_port_arduino() to get the port. If no port is found, the script exits.
  - Initializes the serial connection.
  - Generates a unique filename with a timestamp.
  - Defines duree_max (maximum recording duration, here 10 minutes).
  - Opens the CSV file in write mode and writes the header.
  - Enters an infinite loop that terminates when duree_max is reached.
  - Inside the loop:
     - Reads a line from the serial port.
     - Decodes and cleans the line.
     - Ignores lines starting with # (comments).
     - Adds the real PC timestamp to the data line.
     - Displays the complete line in the console and writes it to the CSV file.
     - Updates the last save time to show minute-by-minute progress.
   - Handles exceptions (KeyboardInterrupt, serial.SerialException, UnicodeDecodeError, Exception).
   - Ensures proper closure of the serial connection in the finally block.

**Usage**

To use this script :
 1. Ensure your Arduino board is connected and the Arduino program is sending data over the serial port.
 2. Close any other program that might be using the serial port (especially the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor).
 3. Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    python3 recuperationDataArretTimerEachTime.py
 4. Data will begin to display in your terminal and will be saved to a timestamped CSV file in the same directory as the script. The script will automatically stop after 10 minutes.
