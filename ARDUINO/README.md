# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

The integrated development environment (Integrated Development Environment abbreviated IDE) is
a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. A
IDE typically includes a graphical interface to launch the different tools, an editor for
source code, a compiler, a debugger, and often a tool for building
software graphical interfaces

## Arduino IDE

Makers, students, and professionals use the classic Arduino IDE (environment
integrated development) since the birth of Arduino. The Arduino IDE 2.0 is an improvement
classic IDE, with increased performance, improved user interface and
many new features, such as auto-completion, a built-in debugger and
synchronization of sketches with Arduino Cloud.
The new major version of the Arduino IDE is faster and even more powerful! In addition to a
more modern editor and a more responsive interface, it offers auto-completion, navigation
in code and even a live debugger.

There are in fact several methods for programming an ESP32 card, 
but for reasons standardization and to limit the number of software, 
we will use the Arduino IDE tool which is quite easy to use. 
The Arduino card is very easily programmable with this software,
however it will be necessary to make some preparations to be able to program the ESP32,
in particular install the ESP32 card itself.
Download and install the Arduinode IDE from the official [Arduino.cc Website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

# Preparing the ESP-WROOM-32D microcontrollerTo develop applications for ESP-WROOM-32D, you needed:

- PC loaded with Ubuntu 22.04.1  LTS operating system
- Toolchain to create application for ESP32
- ESP-IDF or Arduino which essentially contains the API for ESP32 and scripts to do
operate toolchain
- A text editor to write programs (Projects) in C for example Eclipse
- The ESP32 board itself and a USB cable to connect it to the PC
