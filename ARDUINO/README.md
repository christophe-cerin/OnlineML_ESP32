There are in fact several methods for programming an ESP32 card, but for reasons
standardization and to limit the number of software, we will use the Arduino IDE tool which is
quite easy to use. The Arduino card is very easily programmable with this software,
however it will be necessary to make some preparations to be able to program the ESP32,
in particular install the ESP32 card itself.
Download and install the Arduinode IDE from the official [Arduino.cc Website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
