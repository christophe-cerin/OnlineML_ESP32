## Neighborhood Algorithm (KNN): What is the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm ?

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method used to address classification and regression problems in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection.

It is widely used in real-world scenarios because it is non-parametric, meaning it makes no underlying assumptions about the distribution of the data (i.e. assuming a Gaussian distribution of data). We are given prior data (also called training data), which classifies coordinates into groups identified by an attribute.
