## Online machine learning and online learning technique with real data

Online machine learning is a machine learning method in which data becomes available in sequential order and is used to update 
the best predictor of future data at each step. The batch learning technique generates the best predictor by learning 
the entire training data in one go. Continuous learning means constantly improving the model by dealing with continuous 
flows of informationÂ being difficult since the continuous acquisition of progressively available products.

### Motivations and Challenges

Our goal is to design a model capable of learning from new data without revisiting past data, a model that is also robust 
to conceptual drift. This developed model will be very close to what happens in a production context, which is generally event-based. 
It will integrate well with the rest of the programming ecosystem for embedded systems.

Clustering is the target because online data is produced at low frequency from a small number of sensors. Smart building systems use 
sensors and data analytics to monitor energy consumption in real time, allowing building managers to optimize energy consumption 
and reduce costs.
The clustering application is a visualization tool that will simplify tasks such as controlling building temperature, 
maintaining equipment via mobile devices and computers.
